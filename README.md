As a Computer Science Honors student at Texas A&M, I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for artificial intelligence and its potential to create robust solutions. As I begin my college journey, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities or collaborative projects that allow me to further my skills and contribute to meaningful AI-driven initiatives. 

My projects embody my goals, and I've independently developed integrated modular AI agents, neural networks, small language model fine-tunes, and command-line applications using a wide array of industry-standard tools and frameworks. I've also got industry experience in developing and deploying AI agents supported by a fleet of tools, including Langchain, MCP servers, databases and Redis caches.
