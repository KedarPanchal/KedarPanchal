As an incoming Engineering Honors student at Texas A&M, I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for artificial intelligence and its potential to create innovative solutions. I love creating projects using whatever piques my interest, applying what I learn in school and in my free time to create tools that I can use in my day-to-day life. These projects cover a variety of fields, from AI-powered image manipulation to synthesizer development to CLI tools that improve my programming workflow.
